<h3>About</h3>

<br>

<p>TPYO MAG (stylized as "T|P|Y|O Mag", <i>tpyo magazine</i>, or Tpyo) is a literary magazine celebrating works that contain typos. There are many reasons the typo is deserving of celebration. Typos can be funny! They can be humbling! Users of the website Twitter have called typos a strike against colonialist and abelist standards. But most importantly, typos reminds us that we are human.</p>

<br>

<p><strong><em>In addition to publishing typos, we also publish mistranslations, physical or digital artifacts, or any other "mistake" intentionally kept.</em></strong> To get a sense of what we're looking for, consider reading <a href="htmls/tommys/pdfs/md3.pdf">the only story published on this website as of right now</a>. Or you could write something yourself and submit it right right now so we can display a second example of what we're looking for!</p>

<br>

<p> TPYO MAG is socially owned and democratically controlled. Currently our organizational structure is that of the trivial co-op&mdash;we only have one member. Once two or three more people are interested in contributing the the magazine, we can collectively envision what it will look like going forward.</p>

<h4>Hello?</h4>

<br>

<p>hello!</p>

<br><br> 

<h4>Oh shit! Hi! Oh sorry for swearing, I hope that is OK. Honestly, I didn't think this would get a response. Oh wait. Hmm. <br><br> Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. <br><br> I really wasn't expecting a response, and I don't know what to ask. Any suggestions?</h4>

<br>

<p>yes! well, you can probably tell this website is under construction right now. you could ask something about that. or.</p>

<br>

<p>uh. idk. i don't want to finish the qafs riight now.</p>

<br><br> 

<h4>Ah I see, so these questions aren't actually frequently asked at all?</h4>

<br>

<p>yeah sorry got to go bye.</p>

<br><br> 

<h4>Any idea when you're coming back?</h4>

<br>

<p>well right now it's mid-march. i'll be around for the next hour or so to answer any questions. sso ask awwwaaaay.</p>

<br><br> 

<h4>When are you planning on updating the site and adding more content? What about more content that's not just the Questions, Frequently Asked? Do you have any plans to address accessibility concerns on Tpyo? What does Tpyo most need from its supporters? How can I help? Is any of this text permanent? Who <em>are</em> you?</h4>

<br>

<p>can you slwo down.</p>

<p>please.</p>

<br><br> 

<h4>Like this?</h4>

<br>

<p>yes! thank you so much.</p>

<br><br> 

<h4>What changes to the site are you planning on making, and when?</h4>

<br> 

<p>a great question! first, ntoe you can always track the changes being made on out github <a href="https://github.com/jhomathy/jhomathy.github.io">here</a>.</p>

<p>we have a genuine, real-live poem being edited right now, which will be up at the end of march. also by the end of march, we'd like to have a nav-bar on each page, along with a page of the magazine's contributors. depending on tommy's ability to stay focused in april, we may have a demo release then! if that goes well (or honestly even if it flops hard) we'll shift focus from producing content to marketing that content.</p>

<br><br> 

<h4>Contributors? Are those the same thing as members?</h4>

<br> 

<p><em>contributors</em> are anyone whose work is being published by <i>tpyo magazine</i>. our members include our contributors, as well as editors and promoters. if an author publish in <i>tpyo magazine</i> under multiple pseudonyms, they only count as one member.</p>

<br><br> 

<h4>Does Tpyo pay its contributors?</h4>

<br> 

<p>not even in clout.</p>

<br><br> 

<h4>So how's that draft going? Is it...real?</h4>

<br> 

<p>of course it's real it's just hiddden on the secret D|R|A|F|T|S page right nopw.</p>

<br>`;
  document.getElementById("qafsmarch2021").innerHTML = toDisplay;

</script>

<br><br> 

<h4>Where did all the other QAFs go?</h4>
