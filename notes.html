  Tommy: how do we decide when the meeting ends ?<br>
  LEF: consensus <br>
  
  <br>

  Tommy: if you want me to make a note, say something like "make a note of that" <br>
  LEF: one of my tasks if to make sure Tommy does their tasks <br>
  Tommy: one of my tasks if to make sure LEF does their tasks <br>

  <br>

  <strong>*LEF will produce final drafts of contents (like a temp editor-in-chief)*</strong> <br>
  <strong>*Tommy will find out how to host "final drafts of contents"*</strong> <br> 

  <br>

  <strong>*LEF is the poetry content editor*</strong> <br>
  <strong>*Tommy is the stories content editor*</strong> <br>

  <br>

  *added lef as a github contributor* <br>

  <br>

  <strong>liveline for Tommy;  April 16, 24:00: navbar</strong> <br> 
  <strong>liveline for Tommy; April 17, 24:00: be able to host poems</strong> <br> 
  <strong>liveline for for Tommy; April 17, 24:00: be able to host stories</strong> <br> 
  <strong>liveline for for Tommy; April 18, 24:00: submission page </strong> <br> 

  <br>

  LEF: do we need a promoter? <br>
  Tommy: yeah <br>
  LEF: ok. <br>
  LEF: when? <br>
  Tommy: uh..  i think we need more things completed before others will take genuine interest. so that's,.,, after the poem + story hosting is up, and once we have a submissions page and process that has actually processed a submission, <br>
  LEF: ok. <br>

  <br>

  LEF: should that (the previous section) be bolded? <br>
  Tommy: i'm trying to bold all the sections with 
  <ul>
    <li> <em>livelines</em>, like deadlines but if you don't meet it instead of dying you get to stay alive (you just need to check-in about their progress with the person who assigned them to you) </li>
    <li> and or things that are "lasting" jobs, ones you could say you did across multiple tpyo meetings and could make yourself a fancy title for if you ever wanted to put this on a resume. </li>
  </ul>
  LEF: great. <br>
  Tommy: <em>definitions</em>, words that are then defined, are put in emphatics.  <br>

  <br>

  *consensus has been reached and we are going to sleep*  <br>
