<h3>"Clanging"</h3> 

<br> <br>

Dump truck lump sum <br>
Glass plastic elastic band tin can <br>
Wind chime time and engine time <br>
the garbage can man can stand <br>
On sixth and A at six am, <br>
The introductory city-symphony timpani, <br>
The pandemic time pan drum run <br>
Before the sun comes. <br>

<br>

And at the corner of the street <br>
A cop stops to hear the voice of God <br>
Why do you persecute me <br>
And Saul became Paul, and <br>
Swore in his soul, once and for all: <br>
I will never again prosecute you, personally, o lord.  <br>
He did not. Pop-pop-pop. <br>

<br>

Those not in the know about columbiformes <br>
sometimes mistake morning doves for owls, <br>
The woeful coo coo after the pop-pop at seven o'clock <br>
(it's always seven o'clock, that's my problem) <br>
Too soft to be a cuckoo clock: <br>
A kind of exceptionalism, <br>
That a much rarer bird would be circling the neighborhood, <br>
among the so-called sky rats, <br>
just out of sight, but within earshot. <br>
